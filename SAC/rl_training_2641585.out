'mamba' is running as a subprocess and can't modify the parent shell.
Thus you must initialize your shell before using activate and deactivate.

To initialize the current  shell, run:
    $ eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell )"
and then activate or deactivate with:
    $ mamba activate
To automatically initialize all future () shells, run:
    $ mamba shell init --shell  --root-prefix=~/.local/share/mamba
If your shell was already initialized, reinitialize your shell with:
    $ mamba shell reinit --shell 
Otherwise, this may be an issue. In the meantime you can run commands. See:
    $ mamba run --help

Supported shells are {bash, zsh, csh, posix, xonsh, cmd.exe, powershell, fish, nu}.
